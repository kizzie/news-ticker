# News Ticker

This project is based off a request from a friend for an event they were running. They
wanted to have a very simple news ticker type website that they could submit events to
and they would be searchable and pop up over time.

This is also my first nestjs project and I thought I would combine the two together. 
Take anything in here with a pinch of salt as it may not be best practices (or it may
be best practices from java, python or go, all of which I know better!)

Current plans:

- [ ] Submit a news story
- [ ] See a list of the available news stories
- [ ] Store the stories in nosql db 
- [ ] Search for stories based on keywords
- [ ] restrict posting endpoint to event runner
- [ ] post stories at x date
- [ ] log into the site to see other content (contracts etc.)
- [ ] gha build
- [ ] terraform deployment 
- [ ] Add some css for the event
